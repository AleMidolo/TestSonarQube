    Decorator for transaction functions that allows additional control over how the transaction is executed.

    :param metadata: A dictionary with metadata. The specified metadata will be associated with the executing transaction and visible in the output of `dbms.listQueries` and `dbms.listTransactions` procedures. It will also be logged in the `query.log` file.
    :type metadata: dict

    :param timeout: The transaction timeout in seconds. Transactions that run longer than the configured timeout will be terminated by the database. This feature allows limiting the execution time of queries/transactions. The specified timeout overrides the default timeout configured in the database using the `dbms.transaction.timeout` setting. The value must not be negative. A duration of zero will allow the transaction to run indefinitely. A value of `None` will use the default timeout configured in the database.
    :type timeout: float or None
